            As a recent graduate with a Master of Science degree in Building Science, I am eager to pursue further opportunities to advance my knowledge and skills in this exciting field. With a strong background in data-driven approaches to building performance simulation, as well as experience in research and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RQxtlz8AkG8C&hl=en ">publication</a>, I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to the industry.Throughout my academic career, I have been particularly interested in exploring the use of data to inform building design and operation. My research has focused on topics such as energy efficiency, daylighting, fire evacuation, and occupant behavior, and I have authored several journal papers in these areas. Through my work, I have gained valuable insights into how data can be used to optimize building performance, reduce energy consumption, and improve indoor environmental quality.In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained practical experience working in both a fablab and a research lab at Shahid Beheshti University. These experiences have allowed me to develop hands-on skills with cutting-edge technologies and techniques in building science, as well as to collaborate with other experts in the field.I have also shared my knowledge and expertise through my role as a lecturer in IBPSA for data science in building science. Through this position, I have helped to train the next generation of building scientists and engineers, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing the industry todayLooking ahead, I am excited to continue pursuing new opportunities to contribute to the field of building science. Whether through further research, industry partnerships, or other avenues, I am committed to advancing our understanding of how buildings can be designed and operated to meet the needs of occupants while minimizing their impact on the environment.Overall, I believe that my passion for building science, combined with my academic and practical experience, make me an ideal candidate for further study or employment in this field.

              The importance of saving energy in the current decade has drawn more attention to optimising energy consumption factors. One of the influential and well-known factors affecting energy consumption is the occupants' behaviours (OBs). Reviewing this factor is a requirement to assess buildings, particularly the residential sector, as the majority target of the building industry. In this study, occupants' energy behaviours in Shahid Pakdel residential complex in Isfahan, Iran, are studied based on Annex 53 questionnaire and building performance simulation (BPS). The main objective of this study is to identify the impact of apartment improvement and OBs, including windows opening, curtain controlling behaviour, and turning on heating equipment in the cold season on energy consumption. Due to the invisible effect of some behaviours, especially for gas consumption (GC) and electricity consumption (EC), structural equation modelling (SEM) is applied to evaluate the impacts of OBs. This case study showed that the most influential behaviour factor is related to the improvement sector with a 41.7% share of EC. Moreover, the most negligible influential factor is associated with windows opening with 21.6% of the EC. Regarding GC, the most and the least determining behaviour factor were attributed to apartment improvement and curtain controlling behaviour with an effective rate of 64.5 and 5%, respectively. This result showed the high impact of apartment improvement on reducing GC and EC. The overall effect of behaviour on GC and EC was 46 and 44%, respectively, measured by the partial least squares (PLS) regression and R2 score..

              In shared office spaces, occupants' comfort criteria are limited to locally controlled zones while ambient features of the environment and the potential negative impacts of others' behavior require a well-designed control system, especially over adaptive façade elements. This means setting up control strategies for a wider spectrum of varying comfort perceptions from person to person dictates an approach towards personalizing adaptive facades. Thereby, this research coupled a simulation-based methodology with fuzzy logic and a genetic algorithm to personalize façade modules based on the visual discomfort conditions of the occupants. Results confirmed that increasing the control freedom by personalization accounting for multi-objective criteria including glare, daylight, and view could satisfy occupants from 83% to 100%. Moreover, the proposed façade personalization framework could enhance visual comfort compared with two typical automated Venetian blind controls, significantly. This study provides novel insights for designers and operators to decentralize facades' elements by accepting occupants’ feedback as part of their control loops.

            <h3>journal:Journal of Building Performance Simulation</h3>
            <h3>year: Jan 2023</h3>
           
            <p>
              As a critical factor in architectural design , emergency evacuation is influenced by numerous parameters. Designers utilize modelling software to evaluate their sketches after completion ofbasic design. However, no various alternatives of early design stages could be assessed via simulations, since it is a time-consuming procedure. In this study, deep-learning algorithms have been adapted for the assessment of the evacuation process at early design stages. The main methods applied include an image-to-image translation with a conditional GAN (Pix2Pix) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The developed Pix2Pix model generates the heat maps of possible route congestions with a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.89. Besides, the XGBoost model predicts the evacuation time with the mean absolute error (MAE) and R2 values of 36 s and 0.94, respectively. This method generates the results of intended analyses at high speed and is a reliable alternative for time-consuming evacuation simulations in early design stages.

              A web-based app for view analysis with fuzzy inference system based on British Standard Institute handbook is a tool that lets you design and test a fuzzy inference system (FIS) for view analysis. The app provides capabilities to design Mamdani systems and lets you design, simulate, compare, and export fuzzy inference systems. The app inputs some features like the number of floors and neighbor situation and calculates a fuzzy score for an alternative.

              Sometimes, when your daylight simulations are done and some daylight indexes are calculated, you are going to compare your design alternatives. This app lets you calculate the score of each alternative when several options confuse you. It considers SDA, ASE, SDGP, and UDI as input and calculates the fuzzy score as output.
