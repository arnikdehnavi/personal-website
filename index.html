            <h3>journal:Frontiers in Sustainable Cities </h3>
            <h3>year:march 2022</h3>
           
            <p>
              The importance of saving energy in the current decade has drawn more attention to optimising energy consumption factors. One of the influential and well-known factors affecting energy consumption is the occupants' behaviours (OBs). Reviewing this factor is a requirement to assess buildings, particularly the residential sector, as the majority target of the building industry. In this study, occupants' energy behaviours in Shahid Pakdel residential complex in Isfahan, Iran, are studied based on Annex 53 questionnaire and building performance simulation (BPS). The main objective of this study is to identify the impact of apartment improvement and OBs, including windows opening, curtain controlling behaviour, and turning on heating equipment in the cold season on energy consumption. Due to the invisible effect of some behaviours, especially for gas consumption (GC) and electricity consumption (EC), structural equation modelling (SEM) is applied to evaluate the impacts of OBs. This case study showed that the most influential behaviour factor is related to the improvement sector with a 41.7% share of EC. Moreover, the most negligible influential factor is associated with windows opening with 21.6% of the EC. Regarding GC, the most and the least determining behaviour factor were attributed to apartment improvement and curtain controlling behaviour with an effective rate of 64.5 and 5%, respectively. This result showed the high impact of apartment improvement on reducing GC and EC. The overall effect of behaviour on GC and EC was 46 and 44%, respectively, measured by the partial least squares (PLS) regression and R2 score..

            <h3>journal:Journal of Building Engineering </h3>
            <h3>year:June 2023</h3>

            <p>
              In shared office spaces, occupants' comfort criteria are limited to locally controlled zones while ambient features of the environment and the potential negative impacts of others' behavior require a well-designed control system, especially over adaptive façade elements. This means setting up control strategies for a wider spectrum of varying comfort perceptions from person to person dictates an approach towards personalizing adaptive facades. Thereby, this research coupled a simulation-based methodology with fuzzy logic and a genetic algorithm to personalize façade modules based on the visual discomfort conditions of the occupants. Results confirmed that increasing the control freedom by personalization accounting for multi-objective criteria including glare, daylight, and view could satisfy occupants from 83% to 100%. Moreover, the proposed façade personalization framework could enhance visual comfort compared with two typical automated Venetian blind controls, significantly. This study provides novel insights for designers and operators to decentralize facades' elements by accepting occupants’ feedback as part of their control loops.

            <h3>journal:Journal of Building Performance Simulation</h3>
            <h3>year: Jan 2023</h3>
           
            <p>
              As a critical factor in architectural design , emergency evacuation is influenced by numerous parameters. Designers utilize modelling software to evaluate their sketches after completion ofbasic design. However, no various alternatives of early design stages could be assessed via simulations, since it is a time-consuming procedure. In this study, deep-learning algorithms have been adapted for the assessment of the evacuation process at early design stages. The main methods applied include an image-to-image translation with a conditional GAN (Pix2Pix) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The developed Pix2Pix model generates the heat maps of possible route congestions with a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.89. Besides, the XGBoost model predicts the evacuation time with the mean absolute error (MAE) and R2 values of 36 s and 0.94, respectively. This method generates the results of intended analyses at high speed and is a reliable alternative for time-consuming evacuation simulations in early design stages.

            <h3>journal:Journal of Renewable and New Energy </h3>
            <h3>year:March 2023</h3>
            <p>
              The purpose of this research was to alleviate deprivation in underprivileged rural areas of Iran by energy production through photovoltaic panels. First, the poverty map of the country has been analyzed along with the sunlight gain potential map of Iran. 79 villages with extremely high and high deprivation conditions were identified. In order to analyze these areas and prioritize them for decision-making in energy sector policy, the areas were categorized into four clusters by the K-means machine learning algorithm. According to the clustering results, the priorities for deprivation elimination through energy production have been identified. Also, the income of each village from two sources was calculated according to the existing tariffs: First, a 5 kW photovoltaic panel for each household and second, a one megawatt power plant located in the barren lands around the villages. The results indicate that Sistan and Baloochestan Province is the top priority in application of photovoltaic panels for energy production. For instance, Bampasht village with a deprivation index of 0.540 and energy production of 9.37 MW per year from a solar power plant, has obtained the highest rank among the villages for deprivation alleviation by energy production through photovoltaic panels.

              A web-based app for view analysis with fuzzy inference system based on British Standard Institute handbook is a tool that lets you design and test a fuzzy inference system (FIS) for view analysis. The app provides capabilities to design Mamdani systems and lets you design, simulate, compare, and export fuzzy inference systems. The app inputs some features like the number of floors and neighbor situation and calculates a fuzzy score for an alternative.

              Sometimes, when your daylight simulations are done and some daylight indexes are calculated, you are going to compare your design alternatives. This app lets you calculate the score of each alternative when several options confuse you. It considers SDA, ASE, SDGP, and UDI as input and calculates the fuzzy score as output.

              There are several design strategies that architects who want to design sustainable buildings must consider. These strategies include the use of natural ventilation, passive solar design, and the use of sustainable materials. This app allows architects to try several strategies in hot and humid climates in Iran at the early stage of design. The app provides a platform for architects to test different design strategies and see how they perform in different climates. This can help architects to make informed decisions about the design of sustainable buildings.

              This app allows you to draw your region and select your lightings to calculate the effect of each type of lumps in your design. You can specify the type of lighting, the size of the lumps, and the location of the lumps. The app then calculates the effect of each type of lump on the lighting in your design. This app is powered by artificial intelligence, which can help you to make informed decisions about the placement of lumps in your design.
