              The importance of saving energy in the current decade has drawn more attention to optimising energy consumption factors. One of the influential and well-known factors affecting energy consumption is the occupants' behaviours (OBs). Reviewing this factor is a requirement to assess buildings, particularly the residential sector, as the majority target of the building industry. In this study, occupants' energy behaviours in Shahid Pakdel residential complex in Isfahan, Iran, are studied based on Annex 53 questionnaire and building performance simulation (BPS). The main objective of this study is to identify the impact of apartment improvement and OBs, including windows opening, curtain controlling behaviour, and turning on heating equipment in the cold season on energy consumption. Due to the invisible effect of some behaviours, especially for gas consumption (GC) and electricity consumption (EC), structural equation modelling (SEM) is applied to evaluate the impacts of OBs. This case study showed that the most influential behaviour factor is related to the improvement sector with a 41.7% share of EC. Moreover, the most negligible influential factor is associated with windows opening with 21.6% of the EC. Regarding GC, the most and the least determining behaviour factor were attributed to apartment improvement and curtain controlling behaviour with an effective rate of 64.5 and 5%, respectively. This result showed the high impact of apartment improvement on reducing GC and EC. The overall effect of behaviour on GC and EC was 46 and 44%, respectively, measured by the partial least squares (PLS) regression and R2 score..

              In shared office spaces, occupants' comfort criteria are limited to locally controlled zones while ambient features of the environment and the potential negative impacts of others' behavior require a well-designed control system, especially over adaptive façade elements. This means setting up control strategies for a wider spectrum of varying comfort perceptions from person to person dictates an approach towards personalizing adaptive facades. Thereby, this research coupled a simulation-based methodology with fuzzy logic and a genetic algorithm to personalize façade modules based on the visual discomfort conditions of the occupants. Results confirmed that increasing the control freedom by personalization accounting for multi-objective criteria including glare, daylight, and view could satisfy occupants from 83% to 100%. Moreover, the proposed façade personalization framework could enhance visual comfort compared with two typical automated Venetian blind controls, significantly. This study provides novel insights for designers and operators to decentralize facades' elements by accepting occupants’ feedback as part of their control loops.
